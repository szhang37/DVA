Johns Hopkins - Dynamic Visual Acuity Testing Android App

Version 0.01 was released in Nov'13 and flight tested.  This version does not include embedded DVA test scoring.

In DVA, subjects read letters of decreasing optotype size on the tablet screen while moving their head.  The inability to read progressively smaller letters during head movements is indicative of vestobule-ocular impairment.
